## Difference Between Document and Window Objects in JavaScript

JavaScript is a key language for making web pages interactive and dynamic. Two important parts of
JavaScript for web development are the window and document objects.

## What is the Window Object?
     The window object represents the browser window or tab. It is the global
     object in a web page and includes many properties and methods you can use. Here are some 
     important things about the window object:

** Global Scope:**
    All global variables and functions in JavaScript belong to the window object.

    var globalVar = "Hello";
    console.log(window.globalVar); // Outputs: Hello

** Browser Methods:**
    Methods like alert(), confirm(), and setTimeout() are part of the window object.

    window.alert("Hello, world!");

** Browser Information:**
    It contains information about the browser and screen, such as window size 
    (window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight) and the current URL (window.location).

## What is the Document Object?
    The document object represents the HTML content of the web page. It is a 
    property of the window object and is used to interact with the HTML elements. 

** Accessing HTML Elements:**
    You can access and manipulate HTML elements using methods like getElementById(), 
    querySelector(), and createElement().

    var header = document.getElementById("header");
    header.textContent = "Hello, world!";


Modifying HTML Content: You can read and change the content and structure of HTML elements.
var newParagraph = document.createElement("p");
newParagraph.textContent = "This is a new paragraph.";
document.body.appendChild(newParagraph);

** Handling Events:**
   You can attach event listeners to HTML elements to respond to user actions 
   like clicks and key presses.

    document.addEventListener("click", function () {
    console.log("Document was clicked.");
    });


## Differences Between Window and Document Objects

** Scope and Context:**
   ** Window:**
       Represents the browser window and is the global scope for JavaScript.
   ** Document:**
       Represents the HTML document and is used to interact with the web page's content.

## Properties and Methods:
** Window:**
       Includes methods and properties related to the browser.
** Document:**
       Includes methods and properties related to the HTML content.

## Access:
** Window:**
 Accessed globally (e.g., alert()).
** Document:**
 Accessed via document (e.g., document.getElementById()).

## Conclusion

     The window object is like the frame that holds everything in the browser, while the 
     document object is the content inside that frame.
